Data Analysis Citi-Bike data about bike sharing in New York City
#### Introduction
Citi Bike is New York Cityâ€™s bike share system, and the largest in the nation. The case study involves Citi Bike data of its customer's trip details over a 12-month period (January 2020 - December 2020). The data has been made available by Citi-Bike at https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html

#### Scenario (I made it up for the purpose of the case study)
Marketing team needs to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.
